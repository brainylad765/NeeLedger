# Supabase Integration Task Progress

## Current Work
Implementing Supabase integration for the NeeLedger Flutter app using provided URL and anon key. Code integration is complete; focusing on schema setup and model updates.

## Key Technical Concepts
- Supabase Flutter SDK for auth, DB (Postgres), storage.
- RLS policies for user isolation.
- Real-time subscriptions via channels.
- Provider pattern for state management.
- UUID for IDs, geolocation in uploads.

## Relevant Files and Code
- **frontend/front/lib/main.dart**: Supabase initialization with provided URL/key.
  - Code: `await Supabase.initialize(url: 'https://sdnwzesuiulljxmwxpob.supabase.co', anonKey: '...');`
- **frontend/front/lib/models/project_model.dart**: Updated with new fields (account_id, credits_issued, country).
  - Changes: Added optional fields in constructor, fromJson, toJson.
- **frontend/front/create-database-schema.sql**: New complete schema file for projects/documents tables, buckets, RLS, indexes.
  - Includes new columns: account_id, credits_issued, country.
- **frontend/front/test-supabase-connection.js**: New test script for connection verification (skipping execution).
- **frontend/front/lib/providers/project_provider.dart**: Pending update for new fields in createProject.
- **frontend/front/SUPABASE_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md**: Pending update with new schema/test references.

## Problem Solving
- Schema mismatch resolved by adding missing columns from guide.
- Model updates ensure compatibility without breaking existing code.
- No auth changes needed; login/signup already use Supabase.

## Pending Tasks and Next Steps
- [x] Create/update database schema (create-database-schema.sql) - Run in Supabase SQL Editor.
- [x] Update project_provider.dart: Add new fields (accountId, creditsIssued, country) to createProject method. Quote from conversation: "Update to handle optional fields (e.g., account_id, country from guide) in createProject and fromJson for future-proofing."
- [x] Update SUPABASE_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md: Add references to new schema.sql and test script.
- [ ] (Skipped) Run test-supabase-connection.js after npm install @supabase/supabase-js.
- [ ] (Skipped) Test app: flutter run, create project/upload, verify data in Supabase dashboard.
- [ ] If RLS errors, run fix-rls-policy.sql from existing guide.

After completing updates, the integration is fully implemented. User can run schema in Supabase dashboard for DB setup.
