### 5. App Navigation
- ✅ Updated main.dart to use WelcomeScreen as initial route
- ✅ Added WelcomeScreen to app routes
- ✅ Updated app title to "NeeLedger"

### 6. Dependencies
- ✅ Ran `flutter pub get` to resolve dependencies

### 7. Mobile APK Optimization
- ✅ **Increased timing**: Extended welcome screen duration for better user experience
  - Logo display: 3 seconds (was 2 seconds)
  - About section: 6 seconds (was 3 seconds)
  - Total duration: 10.5 seconds (was 6.5 seconds)
- ✅ **Responsive proportions**: Fixed sizing for mobile APK deployment
  - Logo: 40% of screen width (max 200px)
  - Text sizes: Based on screen width percentages
  - Padding and spacing: Responsive to screen dimensions
  - Added constraints for optimal mobile display

## 🎯 Animation Sequence

1. **Logo Display (0-3s)**: Shows logo image and "NEELEDGER" text with animated gradient
2. **Slide Animation (3-4.5s)**: Logo and text slide to top and stay visible
3. **About Section (4.5-10.5s)**: Shows "NEELEDGER" and about information with lustrous grey background
4. **Navigation (10.5s+)**: Automatically navigates to home screen

## 🎨 Features Implemented

- ✅ Animated gradient text with rotating colors
- ✅ Smooth slide transitions (logo stays visible at top)
- ✅ Logo image integration with error handling
- ✅ Responsive design for mobile screens
- ✅ Professional gradient background
- ✅ Auto-navigation after animation sequence
- ✅ **Reduced font size** for single-line "NEELEDGER" display
- ✅ **Lustrous grey background** for about section
- ✅ **Simplified about text**: "revolutionizing the carbon usage platforms"

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. Test the welcome screen on device/emulator
2. Fine-tune animation timings if needed
3. Add any additional branding elements
4. Test navigation flow to home screen

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

- ✅ **Fixed MediaQuery error**: Removed MediaQuery.of(context) from initState() to prevent "dependOnInheritedWidgetOfExactType" error
- ✅ **Updated slide animation**: Used fixed value (-300.0) instead of dynamic MediaQuery calculation

## 🎨 User Feedback Updates

- ✅ **Fixed overlapping animation**: Logo stays visible at top, no overlapping with about section
- ✅ **Updated about text**: Changed to "revolutionizing carbon monitoring platforms" (single line)
- ✅ **Smaller fonts**: Reduced font sizes for NEELEDGER text (0.045), ABOUT text (0.04), and description (0.035)
- ✅ **Symmetrical screen**: Centered all elements properly, removed left-side shift
- ✅ **Updated timing**: After about section fully displays, hold for 5 seconds then navigate to home screen

## 📝 Notes

- Logo image is loaded from `assets/images/logo.png`
- If logo fails to load, a fallback eco icon is displayed
- Animation uses Flutter's built-in animation controllers
- All text uses Google Fonts (Poppins) for consistency
- App maintains dark theme throughout the welcome sequence
