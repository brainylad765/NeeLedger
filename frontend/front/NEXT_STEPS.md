# 🚀 BlockZen Development Roadmap

## ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Firebase project connection established
- [x] Real-time image upload to Firebase Storage
- [x] Cross-device data synchronization via Firestore
- [x] Evidence provider with Firebase integration
- [x] Document provider with Firebase integration
- [x] Upload progress indicators and error handling

## 🎯 IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

### 1. 📱 **Test on Other Device**
- Deploy the web app to a hosting service (Firebase Hosting, Netlify, Vercel)
- Open the app on your other device
- Upload an image from one device
- Verify it appears on the other device in real-time

### 2. 🔧 **Fix User Authentication**
Currently using placeholder "current_user" - implement proper auth:

```bash
flutter pub add firebase_auth
```

Update providers to use actual user IDs:
- `lib/providers/user_provider.dart` - implement Firebase Auth
- Replace all "current_user" references with actual user IDs

### 3. 🌐 **Deploy to Production**

#### Option A: Firebase Hosting (Recommended)
```bash
firebase init hosting
firebase deploy
```

#### Option B: Netlify
1. Upload `build/web` folder to Netlify
2. Set up custom domain if needed

#### Option C: Vercel
```bash
npm install -g vercel
vercel --prod
```

### 4. 📊 **Enhanced Data Management**

#### Real-time Dashboard
- Add real-time counters for uploaded files
- Show sync status between devices
- Display upload history with timestamps

#### Data Validation
- Add file size limits (e.g., max 10MB per image)
- Validate file types (jpg, png, pdf)
- Add image compression for large files

### 5. 🔒 **Security & Rules**

#### Firebase Security Rules
Update Firestore rules in Firebase Console:
```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Only authenticated users can read/write their own data
    match /evidence/{document} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null 
        && request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;
    }
    match /documents/{document} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null 
        && request.auth.uid == resource.data.uploadedBy;
    }
  }
}
```

#### Storage Security Rules
```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    match /evidence/{allPaths=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
    match /documents/{allPaths=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

### 6. 🎨 **UI/UX Improvements**

#### File Preview
- Show image thumbnails before upload
- Add image cropping/editing tools
- Display file metadata (size, type, dimensions)

#### Bulk Operations
- Multi-file upload with progress bars
- Batch delete functionality
- Export/download all files

### 7. 📈 **Advanced Features**

#### Offline Support
- Cache uploaded images for offline viewing
- Queue uploads when offline, sync when online
- Add offline indicators

#### Search & Filter
- Search uploaded files by name, date, location
- Filter by file type, upload date
- Tag system for better organization

#### Location Features
- Show uploaded images on a map
- Location-based filtering
- GPS metadata preservation

### 8. 🧪 **Testing & Quality**

#### Unit Tests
```bash
flutter test
```

#### Integration Tests
```bash
flutter drive --target=test_driver/app.dart
```

#### Performance Monitoring
- Add Firebase Performance Monitoring
- Track upload speeds and success rates
- Monitor app crashes and errors

### 9. 📱 **Mobile App Development**

#### Native Mobile Features
- Camera integration with native quality
- Push notifications for sync updates
- Background upload capabilities
- Biometric authentication

#### Platform-Specific Optimization
- iOS: PhotoKit integration
- Android: Scoped storage compliance
- Web: Progressive Web App (PWA) features

### 10. 🔄 **CI/CD Pipeline**

#### GitHub Actions
```yaml
name: Deploy to Firebase
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

## 💡 **DEVELOPMENT TIPS**

### Debugging Firebase Issues:
```bash
# Enable Firebase debugging
flutter run -d chrome --web-renderer html --enable-software-rendering
```

### Hot Reload for Faster Development:
```bash
flutter run -d chrome --hot
```

### Check Firebase Connection:
Open browser console and look for:
- ✅ Firebase initialization success
- 🔥 Firebase Storage upload progress
- 📡 Firestore real-time updates

### Performance Monitoring:
- Use Chrome DevTools Network tab
- Monitor Firebase API calls
- Check for memory leaks in long sessions
